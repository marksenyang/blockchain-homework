# Cash Study - Coinbase

## What is Coinbase
Coinbase is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, it has become a standard on-ramp for new crypto investors. Coinbase offers a wide variety of products including cryptocurrency investing, an advanced trading platform (Coinbase Pro), custodial accounts for institutions, a wallet for retail investors (Coinbase Wallet), and its own U.S. dollar stable-coin.

Coinbase was founded in 2012 and is a fully regulated and licensed cryptocurrency exchange. Coinbase initially only allowed for Bitcoin trading but quickly began adding cryptocurrencies that fit its decentralized criteria.
Its list expanded to include Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, and many others with the promise of more as long as its requirements are met.

## Coinbase IPO
Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., has announced plans to go public—but it will eschew the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process of hiring investment banks to drum up interest and finance the deal.

Instead, Coinbase plans to post its shares straight on an exchange via a so-called direct listing, a technique pioneered by big names like Spotify (SPOT) and Palantir (PLTR) in recent years.

This nontraditional yet trendy choice makes a certain amount of sense for the Coinbase narrative, given that the company has aided and abetted the similarly non-establishment cryptocurrency craze over the past decade. Whether Bitcoin itself actually replaces dollars or develops further as a speculative asset remains to be seen.

Coinbase has raised more than $US500 million ($632 million) from backers that include Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator and Greylock Partners, according to its website. It was valued at more than $US8 billion in 2018 after a $US300 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management.

Coinbase’s revenue more than doubled last year from 2019 as it swung to a profit. The company reported a net income of $US322 million on net revenue of $US1.14 billion for 2020, compared to a net loss of $US30 million on revenue of $US483 million a year earlier. It has 43 million verified users, of which 2.8 million use transact on the platform monthly, the filing shows.

## Help crypto achieve wider adoption

### Payment System
Coinbase has won a U.S. patent for an invention that allows bitcoin to be sent via email, something that could help bitcoin and crypto achieve wider adoption.

The patent, granted earlier this month after being filed back in March 2015, outlines a system that allows users to make bitcoin payments using an email address linked to a cryptocurrency wallet.

"Bitcoin can be sent to an email address," the patent filing read, detailing the advantages of the technology. "No miner's fee is paid by a host computer system. Instant exchange allows for merchants and customers to lock in a local currency price. A tip button rewards content creators for their efforts. A bitcoin exchange allows for users to set prices that they are willing to sell or buy bitcoin and execute such trades."

The technology could mean a big step for mainstream adoption of bitcoin—something that's been a long-term goal of Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong.

Earlier this year, Armstrong said he wants to use bitcoin to create an inclusive financial system and believes Coinbase will be less about trading and more about adoption in as little as five years time.

"The vision for Coinbase is creating more economic freedom for every person and business in the world over the next 10 years," Armstrong said in August.

### Coinbase Card
Coinbase has announced that US customers can now join the waitlist for its Coinbase Card, a debit Visa card that allows customers to spend cryptocurrency anywhere Visa cards are accepted. Coinbase claims it’s “the easiest, quickest way to spend your crypto worldwide.” 

There are a number of debit cards around the world that allow you to spend cryptocurrency (you’ll soon be able to do so with Paypal as well). But many platforms require you to load funds onto the card in order to spend them. The Coinbase Card eliminates the middleman, instead pulling funds directly from your Coinbase account. Other cards are limited to one or a few currencies; the Coinbase Card supports more than 30, according to the company (and converts everything to US dollars before completing purchases and ATM withdrawals).
